# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:

  
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
     

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Product Sans
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/font/Product_Sans_Bold.ttf
        - asset: assets/font/Product_Sans_Regular.ttf

    - family: Milkshake
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/font/Milkshake 400.ttf
       
    - family: Celliad
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/font/Celliad.otf
        
    - family: Dark Seed 
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/font/Dark Seed.otf 
      
    - family: KaushanScript-Regular
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/font/KaushanScript-Regular.ttf     

    - family: Pattaya-Regular
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/font/Pattaya-Regular.ttf
