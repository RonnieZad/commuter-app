String kayoolaDescription =
    'The Kayoola Solar Bus concept represents the next generation of public transport for cities within the region. The first of its kind on the African continent, the Kayoola Solar bus relies on lithium-ion batteries to power an electric motor that is coupled to a 2-speed pneumatic shift transmission. This technology serves to conserve the environment and public health. The telltale signatures of traditional diesel engine buses – plumes of dark smoke blowing out of the tailpipe and a grumbling engine sound — are replaced by a soft whine as soon as the electric bus accelerates.\n\nThe prototype which is designed to serve as an Executive City bus, is easy for riders to spot, thanks to the pearl white color adorned by the colors of the national flag. Its uncompromising beauty, elegant design and luxurious interior space bring to mind the rich heritage of the Pearl of Africa. The pearl white body, and wide sliding windows give the Kayoola a graceful exterior, with the proprietary design grille complementing the front.\n\nThe Kayoola Solar Bus will be easier to maintain, in terms of not having to change oil as is done in the diesel-powered buses and not having to repair hydraulic lines that run through a conventional bus. The bus is expected to run 80km, or virtually a full operational day (for example Kampala – Entebbe – Kampala), between recharges.\n\nThe Kayoola offers a smoother and cleaner ride, experiencing less vibration and less noise as the result of replacement of the usual internal combustion diesel engine with an electric machine. The City will love the Kayoola as it quietly cruises past its noisy polluting competitors.';
